The primary purpose of constructing the UML-based Class Diagram was to aid in designing the static structure of the bank application system. Key classes featured in the diagram include BankApp, CustomerAccount, ManagerAccount, and CustomerLevel. It features an Application class that initiates the application with a start method. The CustomerAccount class manages customer details, including account files and balance, with capabilities to log in and handle transactions. CustomerLevel is an interface implemented by Platinum, Gold, and Silver classes, each providing methods for online purchases and balance inquiries. ManagerAccount class provides administrative functions such as managing customer details. An abstract UserAccount class serves as a base for customer accounts, containing common attributes like username and password. The diagram outlines the relationships between these classes and interfaces, illustrating inheritance and implementation within the application's design.


This project has solidified the author's understanding of Object-Oriented Design principles and provided valuable insights into the application of design patterns. Furthermore, it has enhanced the author's proficiency in front-end development through the utilization of the JavaFX library. The creation of UML-based diagrams has been particularly valued for its effectiveness in Object-Oriented Design. In summary, this project has served as a robust skill-building endeavor, contributing significantly to the author's expertise and knowledge.
