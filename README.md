# Bank-App
This is a banking application, which serves as the culminating project for the COE528 course. Utilizing Java and the JavaFX library, this application was created to incorporate a graphical user interface alongside various functional components.

The primary purpose of constructing the UML-based Class Diagram was to aid in designing the static structure of the bank application system. Key classes featured in the diagram include BankApp, CustomerAccount, ManagerAccount, and CustomerLevel. It features an Application class that initiates the application with a start method. The CustomerAccount class manages customer details, including account files and balance, with capabilities to log in and handle transactions. CustomerLevel is an interface implemented by Platinum, Gold, and Silver classes, each providing methods for online purchases and balance inquiries. ManagerAccount class provides administrative functions such as managing customer details. An abstract UserAccount class serves as a base for customer accounts, containing common attributes like username and password. The diagram outlines the relationships between these classes and interfaces, illustrating inheritance and implementation within the application's design.
